# Aaron DeLara's Portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio. Here I have my favorite projects that I have either created myself or created with a group. Not only will this website serve as a memory of the work that I've done, but, it also provides my contact info just in case future employers or groups want to get into contact with me for any collaborations.
